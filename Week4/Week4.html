<h1 id="stocks-and-the-stock-market">Stocks and the Stock Market</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>A stockholder (or shareholder)</strong> has a legal claim on the firm's profits and on its equity (assets minus liabilities).</li>
<li><strong>Stocks</strong> are called equities because ownership of stocks represents partial ownership of a firm</li>
<li><strong>A sole proprietor</strong> (sole owner) is someone who owns a firm and has unlimited liability for the firm's debts.</li>
<li><strong>An investor</strong> who owns stock in a firm organised as a corporation is protected by limited liability</li>
<li><strong>Corporations</strong> are run by the boards of directors who appoint officers, such as CEO, CFO, COO.</li>
<li><strong>Dividend</strong> is a payment that a corporation makes to stockholders (similar to coupon in bond).</li>
<li><strong>Two types of stockholders:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Preferred stockholders $\implies$ receive a fixed dividend that is set when the corporation issues the stock</li>
<li>Common stockholders receive a dividend that fluctuates as the profitability of the corporation varies over time.</li>
<li>Mostly common</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A firm's market capitalisation is the total market value of a firm's common and preferred stock.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measuring-the-performance-of-the-stock-market">Measuring the Performance of the Stock Market</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>A stock market index</strong> is an average of stock prices that is used to measure the overall performance of the stock market.</li>
<li><strong>Fluctuations in the Stock Market</strong>
<ul>
<li>More risk, risky than bonds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="does-the-performance-of-the-stock-market-matter-to-the-economy">Does the Performance of the Stock Market Matter to the Economy?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fluctuations in stock prices can affect the economy by affecting the spending of households and firms</li>
<li>Corporations: Important source of funds</li>
<li>Households: IMportant part of wealth!
<ul>
<li>$\uparrow P_{stock} \implies \uparrow wealth \implies \uparrow Spending$</li>
<li>Then, this loops back to the funds to the company $\implies$ positive loop back</li>
<li>$\uparrow Fluctuations\implies$ $\uparrow \text{Uncertainty (Unlike by Economists, affecting the economics decision)} \implies \text{Negatively Affect Economic Decision}$</li>
<li>Why negative?
<ul>
<li>Cosumers: Delay spending</li>
<li>Firms: Delay investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-determine-the-stock-price">How to Determine the Stock Price?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The price of a financial asset</strong> is equal to the present value of the payments to be received from owning it.</li>
<li><strong>The required return on equities</strong> $(k_e)$ is the expected return necessary to compensate for the risk of investing in stocks
<ul>
<li>Remember that stock is riskier than bonds. Hence it is the expected returns in the bonds market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The equity premium is the additional return investors must receive in order to invest in equities rather Treasury bills.</li>
<li>The equity preium consists of two components:
<ul>
<li>Systematic risk -- price fluctuations in the stock market that affect all stocks</li>
<li>Unsystematic (idosyncratic) risk -- movements in the price of that particular stock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fomulation">Fomulation</h3>
<p>$$k_e = \text{&quot;the expected return&quot; necessary to compensate for Risk}$$
Note the basic assumption here is that if we don't get $k_e$ will not hold a stock.
$$P_S = \text{Expected PV of payments received \hspace{10pt} (More uncertainty and factors that contributes to this)}$$
$$P^S_0 \text{(Price of stock today)} = \frac{D_1}{1 + k_e} + \frac{P^S_1}{1 + k_e}$$
Note that both the dividends and present price in the future are two unknown. The first term is the PV of the dividends, then second term is the PV of the next year's stock price
$$Equity , Premium = k_e - i_b$$
,where $i_b$ is the risk free rates on the treasury bonds (safe assets). Note that the Equity Premium will change over times.</p>
<ul>
<li>Systematic Risk : Associated to the market</li>
<li>Unsystematic (idosyncratic) risk : Associated to corporation</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rate">Rate</h4>
<p>$$\text{Rate of Return on Bonds} = \frac{\text{Coupon}}{\text{Initial Price}} + \frac{\text{Capital Gain/Loss}}{\text{Initial Price}}$$
,where the first term is the coupon yield (known), and the second part is unknown.</p>
<p>Then, similary, we can get:
$$\text{Rate of Return on Stocks} = \frac{\text{&quot;Expected&quot; Dividends}}{\text{Initial Price}} + \frac{\text{Capital Gain/Loss}}{\text{Initial Price}}$$
,now we have two unknowns (both terms are unknown). Therefore, we have larger uncertainty in the stock market.</p>
<p>$$Rt = \frac{D^e_{t+1}}{P_t} + \frac{P^e_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t}$$
,where $R_t$ is the rate of return. <u>This is the same as the word formulat above.</u> Note that there are difference between the tax on dividends, and tax on capital gains.<br>
Note that the <u>Tax on Dividends is subject</u> to double taxation. The following is an illustration of a possible situation.</p>
<p><img src="Double Taxation on Dividends.png" alt="Double Tax for Dividends"></p>
<p>Now, as a certified economist, we care more about the effect of such an economic action.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Problems Associated of Double Taxations</p>
<ul>
<li>Shareholder
<ul>
<li>$\downarrow \text{After-tax return} \implies \downarrow \text{Demands} \implies \uparrow \text{Inefficiency}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firms
<ul>
<li>Retain profit $\implies$ Re-invest $\implies$ might generate inefficiency.</li>
<li>if <strong>rate of return from re-investment</strong> &lt; <strong>rate of return from other users</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taxes on Capital Gain $\rightarrow$ &quot;Lock-in&quot; effect $\implies$ Inefficiency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, why we want to have tax if it creates inefficiency? We are reducing inequalities. This is a typical <u><strong>equalty-efficiency trade-off</strong></u></p>
<h3 id="stock-price-formula">Stock Price Formula</h3>
<p>$$P_0^S = \frac{D_1}{(1 + k_e)^1} + \cdots + \frac{D_n}{(1 + k_e)^n} + \frac{P_n}{(1 + k_e)^n}$$
Note that as $n \rightarrow \infty$, you can ignore the last term since it goes to zero.</p>
<p>Therefore, if $n$ is large enough, $P_0$ is not affected by $P_n$.
$$P^S_0 = \sum_{t=1}^\infty \frac{D_t}{(1+k_e)^t}$$</p>
<p>However, the above formula is very hard to calculate since it very hard to know all the values of the dividends. We call this $(P^S_0)$ the <em><strong>&quot;fundamental value of stock&quot;</strong></em>.</p>
<h3 id="simpler-values">Simpler Values</h3>
<p>However, we do have a simpler models that calculate $P_0^S$, which is Gordern-Growth Model:
$$P_0^S = \frac{(1+g)D_0}{(k_e - g)}$$
,where $D_0$ is the current dividend. We also have to assume the growth rate, $g$ of the dividend. This is assuming the expected profit is increasing.
$$\uparrow \pi^e \text{(expected profit)} \implies \uparrow \text{expected divs.} \implies \uparrow g \implies \uparrow P_0 \text{(2 ways)}$$
Therefore, by involving a little economics here, which is the implication on recession,
$$\text{Recession} \implies \downarrow \pi^e \implies \downarrow \mathbb{E}{\text{Dividends}} \implies \downarrow g$$
Also,
$$\uparrow Unvertainty \implies \uparrow \text{High discount of futures} \implies \uparrow k_e$$
Therefore, both factors above will lead to decrease in the current price of stocks.</p>
<h3 id="now-we-are-in-a-recession-what-will-happen">Now, We are in a Recession... What will happen?</h3>
<p>Monetary Policy: $\downarrow i$ to overcome recession</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Channel (Bond):
<ul>
<li>$\downarrow i \implies \downarrow \text{Return on bonds} \implies \downarrow k_e = i_b + \text{eq. premium} \implies \uparrow P^S_0$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2nd Channel (Stock):
<ul>
<li>$\downarrow i \implies \uparrow \text{Econ Activities} \implies \uparrow \pi^{future} \implies \uparrow \text{Div} \implies \uparrow g \implies \uparrow P^S_0$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we can clearly both channels will cause the increase in stock priceses because of the positive effects on both the growth rate and the expected rate.</p>
<h4 id="assumptions-of-the-gordon-growth-rate-model">Assumptions of the Gordon-Growth Rate Model</h4>
<p>Note that these assumptions are typically quite strong, particularly the assumption of the growth rate is a constant.</p>
<h2 id="how-stock-prices-are-determined">How Stock Prices are Determined?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The price is set by the buyer willing to pay the highest price
<ul>
<li>The market price will be set by the buyer who can take best advantage of the asset</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Superior information about an asset can increase its value by redicing its perceived risk.
<ul>
<li>Information is important for individuals to value each asset</li>
<li>When new information is released about a firm, expectations and prices change</li>
<li>Market participants constantly receive information and revise their expectations, so stock prices change frequently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="rational-expectations-re-and-efficient-market-hypothesis-emh">Rational Expectations (RE) and Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expectations:</strong> are important in the economy because many transactions require participants to forecast the future</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive expectations:</strong> People make forecasts of future values of a variable using only past values of the variable
<ul>
<li>Changes in expectations will occur slowly over time as data changes</li>
<li>However, people use more than just past data to form their expectatios and sometimes change their expectations quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-theory-of-re">The Theory of RE</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expectations will be identical to optimal forecasts using all variables available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is the adaptive expectation:
$$\pi^e_t = (1-\lambda)\pi_{t-1} + (1-\lambda)\lambda\pi_{t-2}$$</p>
<p>However, this is not useful since it only focus on the past and not useful to forecast into the future.</p>
<p>The expected value of an economic variable $X$ should be the optimally forecasted value of the varaible.
$$X^e = X^{Of} (\neq X^{Actual} \text{ is OK!!})$$</p>
<p>Note that $X^C - X^{Actual} =: \text{Forecast Error}$ should not be able to be predicted and have zero mean. Note that these two features are called <u><em><strong>Rational Expectation</strong></em></u>.</p>
<h3 id="rational-expectation-decision-process-example">Rational Expectation Decision Process Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interest rate $(i)$ $\rightarrow$ $i^{normal}$</li>
<li>$i^{today} &gt; i^{normal}$</li>
<li>Optimal Forecast $\implies \downarrow i^{future} ;; (i^{future} \rightarrow i^{normal})$ approaches.</li>
<li>News arrive: if $i$ is high, $i$ will stay high.</li>
<li>Then, revise your optimal forecast: $\uparrow i^{future}$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that how the expectation is changed when a new news arrived. You use all available information!</p>

<p><em><strong>The Efficient Market Hypothesis!!!</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="the-efficient-market-hypothesis">The Efficient Market Hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of the period, we know $P_t$ and $D$</li>
<li>$P_{t+1}$ is unknown and we must form an expectation of it.</li>
<li>The expected return then is
$$R^e = \frac{P^e_{t+1} - P_t + D}{P_t}$$</li>
<li>Expectations of future prices are equal to optimal forecasts using all currently available information so
$$P^e_{t+1} = P^{of}_{t+1} \implies R^e = R^{of}$$</li>
<li>Supply and Demand analysis states $R^e$ will the equilibrium return $R^<em>$, $R^{of} = R^</em>$.</li>
<li>Current prices in a financial market will be set so that the optimal forecast of a security's return using all available information equals the security's equilibrium return.</li>
<li>In an efficient market, a security's price fully reflects all available information.</li>
