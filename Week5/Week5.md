# EMH
Assum
$$R^{of} > R^{actual} \implies \uparrow D \implies \uparrow P_t \implies \downarrow R^{of} \implies R^{of} \approx R^{actual}$$

Therefore, we have the following summaries:
- Random walk
- Diversity is required for any portfolio
- Should hold them long
- Do not follow any recommendations (already incorporated into stock price)

Actual Behaviours $\neq$ Behaviour Describe by EMH

Some important departures are:
- Pricing Anomalies : Investment in small firms > Investment in large firms
- Some stock prices are ***PREDICTABLE*** 
  - Mean reversion
    - $\uparrow R_{today} \implies \downarrow R_{tmrw}$
  - Momentum Investing
    - $\uparrow R_{today} \implies \uparrow R_{tmrw}$
- Variation in stock prices $>$ Changes in the fundamental value of stocks $\implies$ excess variability

Behavioural Finance provide some explainations to some of the issues above which cannot be explained by the EMH

# Behavioural Finance - Excess Volatility
Over-confidence $\implies$ Good/Badd News $\implies$ Noice Trading $\implies$ Herd Behaviour $\implies$ Bubble $\implies$ $P_{asset} > \text{Fundamental Value of Asset}$

# Learning Objectives
- Factors motivate Central Banks
- Money supply of Central Banks
- Central Bank Independence

# Central Bank
They provide money supply to conduct monetary policies to affect ecoonomic policies.

## What are some factors that motivate CBs
- Public Interest View
  - Aim is to maximise well being of society
- Principle Agent View
  - Aim is to maximise their own well-being (Protect their positions)
    - Suppose that:
      - $\text{Before elections} \downarrow i \implies \uparrow \text{Economic activity} \implies \text{Re-elections of the incumbent government}$ $\implies$ Political Business Cycles
  
Both typically present in the reality  
We can avoid the second point happening by having independent CBs.

$$\text{Independent CBs} \implies \downarrow \pi \text{(price stability) w/o generating employment/output inflation}$$

## How a Central Bank Operates 
### Arguments for Central Bank Independence
- The main argument for Central Bank independence is that monetary policy is too important and technical to be determined by politicians
- Because of the frequency of elections, politicians may be shortsighted, concerned with short-term benefits without regard for potential long-term costs.
- The public may well prefer that the experts at the Central Bank, rather than politicians, make monetayr policy decisions.
- Another argument for Central Bank Independence is that complete control of a Central Bank by elected officials increases the influence of political business cycles on the money supply.
### Arguments against CB Independence
- The importance of monetary policy for the economy is also the main argument against central bank independence. 
- In a democracy, elected officials should make public policy. The public could hold elected officials responsible for perceived monetary policy problems.
- If the central bank was controlled by elected officials, monetary policy could be coordinated and integrated with government taxing and spending policies.

### Some insights
Why important? An independent CB is free to pursue its goals without direct interference from government officials and legislators.  
It is also believed that having independence reduce inflation without raising output or employment flucations.  
Note that although it is a good thing, we still need to give it a goal.

# The Money Supply Process
## Learning Objectives
- Explain the relationship between a CB's balance sheet and the monetary base
- Derive the equation for the simple deposit multiplier and understand what it means
- Explain how the behaviour of banks and the nonbank public affect the money multiplier
- Describe the money supply process for M2

## Money Supply Formulation
$$M = m \times B$$
$M$ : money supply  
$m$ : money multiplier  
$B$ : monetary base  

### Monetary base
- CB determines $B$
- Money creation start with $B$
- $B = R + C$, $R$ is reserves, $C$ is currency in circulation.

### Money multipler
Three parties that affect the multiplier:
- Banking system
- Non-bank public
- CBs

### CB Balance Sheet

![Central Bank Balance Sheet](<CB balance sheet.png>)

Reserves (R) = Banks' deposits with CBs + Vault cash (Cash held by banks)
Currency (C) = OUtstanding currency - vault cash => Simly cashes hold by non-bank publics.

***Vault Cash*** is cash that are radily available for day-to-day banking transactions, such as customer withdrawals, deposits and other cash-related services.
